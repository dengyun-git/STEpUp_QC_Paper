## Purpose of this directory:

The full STEpUP OA dataset may be made available by application to the Data Access and Publication Group of STEpUP OA (stepupoa@kennedy.ox.ac.uk) once the primary analysis manuscript is published, in accordance with what is stipulated in our Consortium Agreement. The minimal datasets necessary for replicating figures along with the required R code are provided here.

## The minimal dataset to replicate figures in the paper
Minimal data to replicate main figures in the paper are stored in the folders: "PC1 Driver - Standardisation", "PC1 Driver - Intracellular Protein Score", "PC2 Driver - Bimodal Signal", "Compare to Immunoassay", and "Disease Group After Filtering".

## R code required to process the minimal dataset to replicate figures in the paper
A guide for users to utilize R for processing the minimal data to replicate figures in the paper is presented in the 'vignette-for-replication.Rmd' file (to be opened in the R editor) and 'vignette-for-replication.html' file (to be opened directly for convenient viewing).
